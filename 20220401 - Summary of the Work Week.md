It has been a long week to me as I have been working for almost 10 hours per day at least.

But I do think I did something brilliant over the week.
1. I finished the script to run Depth-First Search for all potential network paths given with a relationship set. This is quite an extraordinary thing.
	1. I used recursion to achieve this.
2. I finished another script to extract all relationship from a P6 database and the corresponding Activity details.
	1. Now that I learn List.PositionOf can use as Match function.
